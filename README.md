# MyMusic

_This is an application that allows to search music from Deezer Api and reproduce it. It is a free version until
I add a logger_

## About the app üìã

The application has a main activity and three principal fragments which are accessed through a bottom navigation bar

The three principal fragments are called Home,Search and MyMusic.
In Home you can explore into top artists, genres, top albums and top tracks.
In Seach you can search tracks, artists and albums by specific consult and explore
into the top playlists.
In MyMusic you will have the tracks that you add as favourites.

Besides, the app contains two more fragments called Artists and Tracks where the 
list of the artists by genre and the tracks of an album, artist or playlist is showed 

For the music reproduction the app the app contains an unique activity that uses 
a media player service

_Like I said at begginig i will add a logger for the ones that have an account in Dezeer_
_This app uses a service but i need to add the background functionalities of it (That something that i continue learning)_
